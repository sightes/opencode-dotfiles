# Governance Injection

When governance rules are not found (or were deleted during legacy cleanup), inject them into the appropriate context file.

## Claude Code

Determine the target file:

1. If `CLAUDE.md` exists and its content is just `@AGENTS.md` (the include pattern set up by swain-init), inject into `AGENTS.md` instead.
2. Otherwise, inject into `CLAUDE.md` (create it if it doesn't exist).

Read the canonical governance content from `references/AGENTS.content.md` and append it to the target file.

## Cursor

Write the governance rules to `.cursor/rules/swain-governance.mdc`. Create the directory if needed.

Prepend Cursor MDC frontmatter to the canonical content from `references/AGENTS.content.md`:

```markdown
---
description: "swain governance — skill routing, pre-implementation protocol, issue tracking"
globs:
alwaysApply: true
---
```

Then append the full contents of `references/AGENTS.content.md` after the frontmatter.

## After injection

Tell the user:

> Governance rules installed in `<file>`. These ensure swain-design, swain-do, and swain-release skills are routable. You can customize the rules — just keep the `<!-- swain governance -->` markers so this skill can detect them on future sessions.

## Stale governance replacement

When swain-doctor's freshness check detects that the installed governance block differs from the canonical source (`references/AGENTS.content.md`), replace the stale block:

1. **Identify the target file** — the file containing the `<!-- swain governance` marker (from the freshness check).

2. **Warn about local edits** — check whether the installed block contains content not present in the canonical source. If so, warn:

   > Your governance block contains local modifications not in the canonical source. These will be overwritten. Move project-specific rules outside the `<!-- swain governance -->` markers before proceeding, or they will be lost.

   If the user declines, report status as **stale (deferred)** and continue.

3. **Replace the block** — delete everything from the `<!-- swain governance` marker line through the `<!-- end swain governance -->` marker line (inclusive), then insert the full contents of `references/AGENTS.content.md` at the same position. Preserve any content before and after the markers.

4. **Report**:

   > Governance block updated in `<file>`. The block was stale — it has been replaced with the current canonical version from `AGENTS.content.md`.
